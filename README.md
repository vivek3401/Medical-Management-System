# Medical-Management-System
In this Project, we aim to solve the traditional issues of hospital management. The existing system provided paper-based solutions for keeping records of patients and hospital staff, but it overloads the doctor and administrator. The main issues were inappropriate data keeping, time wastage in storage, retrieval, and patients being unable to understand prescriptions, etc. These issues are solved by providing a separate user account for doctors and other users. Each patient's data is kept separate and their previous visits can be tracked with a single click. This project uses MySQL as the backend and is developed in Java, providing features such as platform independence, high performance, and security. It is a web application that mainly uses SpringMVC, JDBC, and Servlets frameworks.

It provides enhanced features such as an easy interface to add/remove employees and also provides digital prescriptions. This reduces the need for doctors to manually write and sign prescriptions.
